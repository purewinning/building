# 🎯 TOURNAMENT SELECTION GUIDE - WHERE TO APPLY WINNING STRUCTURE

## 📊 TOURNAMENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

Based on analysis of 4,170+ entry tournament, here's the EXACT formula for identifying which tournaments this strategy works for:

---

## 🏆 OPTIMAL TOURNAMENTS (HIGHEST ROI)

### **Type 1: Small-to-Mid GPPs (3,000-6,000 entries)**

**Characteristics:**
```
Entry Count: 3,000-6,000 entries
Prize Pool: $500K-2M
Payout Structure: Top-heavy (20-30% to 1st)
Cash Line: Top 20-25% cash
Entry Fee: $100-$500
Multi-Entry: 125-150 max
```

**Why This Strategy Works:**
- ✅ Field size allows differentiation with 9-13% avg ownership
- ✅ Leverage QB (3-8%) separates from 95% of field
- ✅ Top-heavy payout rewards unique lineups
- ✅ Not so large that you need extreme leverage
- ✅ Cash line high enough to reward balanced approach

**Examples:**
```
DraftKings:
• NFL $1.25M Wildcat [$333] (4,170 entries) ✅ PERFECT
• NFL $555K Arcade [$111] (5,000 entries) ✅
• NFL $888K Prime Time [$177] (5,000 entries) ✅
• NFL $1M Saturday Special [$222] (4,500 entries) ✅

FanDuel:
• NFL $600K Sunday Million [$125] (4,800 entries) ✅
• NFL $444K Redzone [$111] (4,000 entries) ✅
```

**Expected ROI:** -5% to +15% (multi-entry volume players)
**Winning Structure Effectiveness:** 95/100 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

---

### **Type 2: Mid-Sized GPPs (6,000-15,000 entries)**

**Characteristics:**
```
Entry Count: 6,000-15,000 entries
Prize Pool: $1M-3M
Payout Structure: Moderate top-heavy (15-20% to 1st)
Cash Line: Top 20-22% cash
Entry Fee: $50-$300
Multi-Entry: 150 max
```

**Why This Strategy Works:**
- ✅ Still small enough for 9-13% avg own to work
- ✅ Leverage QB creates big edge
- ✅ Core RB anchor prevents total bust
- ✅ Game stacks provide upside

**Adjustments Needed:**
```python
# Slightly more leverage
ownership_target_avg = (7, 11)  # Down from 9-13
ultra_leverage_required = (4, 5)  # Up from 3-4
qb_ownership_target = (2, 6)     # Down from 2-8
```

**Examples:**
```
DraftKings:
• NFL $2M Sunday Baller [$200] (10,000 entries)
• NFL $1.5M Showdown Captain [$150] (10,000 entries)
• NFL $3M Thursday Kickoff [$300] (10,000 entries)

FanDuel:
• NFL $1.5M Sunday Slam [$100] (15,000 entries)
• NFL $2M Thursday Night [$200] (10,000 entries)
```

**Expected ROI:** -10% to +5%
**Winning Structure Effectiveness:** 80/100 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

---

### **Type 3: Satellite Qualifiers (500-2,000 entries)**

**Characteristics:**
```
Entry Count: 500-2,000 entries
Prize: Tickets to major tournament
Payout Structure: Winners-take-all (top 1-5)
Entry Fee: $20-$100
Multi-Entry: 20-50 max
```

**Why This Strategy Works:**
- ✅ PERFECT for winner-take-all format
- ✅ Leverage QB = instant separation
- ✅ Don't need to min-cash, need to WIN
- ✅ Game stacks create ceiling

**Adjustments Needed:**
```python
# Go FULL LEVERAGE
ownership_target_avg = (6, 10)  # Lower
ultra_leverage_required = (5, 6)  # More
heavy_chalk_max = 0              # None allowed
game_stack_pct = 0.60            # Stack 60% of time
```

**Examples:**
```
DraftKings:
• NFL Milly Maker Satellite [$22] (1,000 entries, 10 winners)
• NFL Live Final Qualifier [$55] (500 entries, 5 winners)
• NFL Daily Satellite [$33] (1,500 entries, 15 winners)

FanDuel:
• NFL Sunday Million Qualifier [$44] (800 entries, 8 winners)
```

**Expected ROI:** -15% to +25% (high variance)
**Winning Structure Effectiveness:** 90/100 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

---

## ⚠️ TOURNAMENTS TO AVOID (Strategy Doesn't Work)

### **Type A: Millionaire Maker / Massive GPPs (100k+ entries)**

**Characteristics:**
```
Entry Count: 100,000-250,000 entries
Prize Pool: $5M-15M
Payout Structure: Ultra top-heavy (40-50% to 1st)
Cash Line: Top 20% cash
Entry Fee: $20-$50
Multi-Entry: 150 max
```

**Why Strategy DOESN'T Work:**
- ❌ Field too large for 9-13% avg ownership
- ❌ Need EXTREME leverage (3-6% avg)
- ❌ Core RB anchor too popular
- ❌ Everyone has game stacks
- ❌ Must fade ALL chalk

**What You Need Instead:**
```python
# Extreme leverage required
ownership_target_avg = (3, 6)    # Much lower
ultra_leverage_required = (6, 7)  # Almost everyone
heavy_chalk_max = 0               # Zero chalk allowed
core_rb_usage_pct = 0.30          # Fade the "obvious" RB

# You need weird shit:
• QB under 2% owned
• RBs under 5% owned
• Zero players over 15% owned
```

**Examples to AVOID with this strategy:**
```
DraftKings:
• NFL Millionaire Maker [$20] (250,000+ entries) ❌
• NFL Sunday Million [$25] (150,000+ entries) ❌

FanDuel:
• NFL Sunday Million [$9] (200,000+ entries) ❌
```

**Winning Structure Effectiveness:** 30/100 ❌

---

### **Type B: Cash Games / Double-Ups**

**Characteristics:**
```
Entry Count: 2-10,000 entries
Payout Structure: Top 50% double money
Entry Fee: $5-$1,000
Multi-Entry: Usually 1-3 max
```

**Why Strategy DOESN'T Work:**
- ❌ Need floor, not ceiling
- ❌ Leverage plays too risky
- ❌ Want chalk for safety
- ❌ Ownership doesn't matter

**What You Need Instead:**
```python
# Play chalk for safety
ownership_target_avg = (20, 30)  # High
ultra_leverage_required = (0, 1)  # Almost none
heavy_chalk_max = 5               # Play the studs
projection_weight = 0.95          # 95% projection

# Play safe:
• CMC if he's 40% owned
• Puka if she's 35% owned
• Safe floor plays
```

**Examples to AVOID with this strategy:**
```
All H2H, 50/50s, Double-Ups ❌
```

---

### **Type C: Small GPPs (Under 500 entries)**

**Characteristics:**
```
Entry Count: 50-500 entries
Prize Pool: $5K-50K
Entry Fee: $20-$200
Multi-Entry: 3-20 max
```

**Why Strategy DOESN'T Work:**
- ❌ Field too small for leverage to matter
- ❌ Need raw projections
- ❌ Variance too high
- ❌ Ownership doesn't separate enough

**What You Need Instead:**
```python
# Play projections
ownership_target_avg = (15, 25)   # Doesn't matter
ultra_leverage_required = (1, 2)  # Few
projection_weight = 0.90          # 90% projection

# Just play studs
```

## 🎯 TOURNAMENT SELECTION FORMULA

### **OPTIMAL RANGE CALCULATOR:**

```python
def is_optimal_tournament(entries, prize_pool, entry_fee):
    """
    Returns True if tournament fits winning structure strategy
    """
    
    # ENTRY COUNT (sweet spot)
    if entries < 3000:
        return False, "Too small - leverage doesn't matter"
    if entries > 15000:
        return False, "Too large - need extreme leverage"
    
    # PRIZE STRUCTURE (need top-heavy)
    first_place_payout = prize_pool * 0.20  # Assume 20% to 1st
    first_place_multiplier = first_place_payout / entry_fee
    
    if first_place_multiplier < 300:

    # ENTRY FEE (sweet spot)
    if entry_fee < 50:
        return False, "Too small - field too recreational"
    if entry_fee > 500:
        return False, "Too expensive - field too sharp"
    
    # PERFECT RANGE
    if 3000 <= entries <= 6000:

            return True, "⭐⭐⭐⭐ GOOD FOR WINNING STRUCTURE (may need adjustments)"
    
    return False, "Outside optimal range"


# EXAMPLES:
is_optimal_tournament(4170, 1250000, 333)
# Returns: (True, "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PERFECT FOR WINNING STRUCTURE")

is_optimal_tournament(150000, 5000000, 20)
# Returns: (False, "Too large - need extreme leverage")

is_optimal_tournament(500, 50000, 100)

## 🎲 ADVANCED: DYNAMIC OWNERSHIP TARGETS

### **Formula for Ownership Adjustment:**

```python
def calculate_ownership_targets(entries):
    """
    Dynamically adjust ownership targets based on field size
    """
    
    if entries < 3000:
        # Small field - ownership matters less
        return {
            'avg_target': (12, 16),
            'ultra_leverage_required': (2, 3),
            'projection_weight': 0.85
        }
    
    elif 3000 <= entries <= 6000:
        # SWEET SPOT - original winning structure
        return {
            'avg_target': (9, 13),
            'ultra_leverage_required': (3, 4),
            'projection_weight': 0.85
        }
    
    elif 6000 <= entries <= 15000:
        # Mid-sized - need more leverage
        return {
            'avg_target': (7, 11),
            'ultra_leverage_required': (4, 5),
            'projection_weight': 0.70
        }
    
    elif 15000 <= entries <= 50000:
        # Large - need serious leverage
        return {
            'avg_target': (5, 9),
            'ultra_leverage_required': (5, 6),
            'projection_weight': 0.60
        }
    
    else:
        # Massive - need extreme leverage
        return {
            'avg_target': (3, 6),
            'ultra_leverage_required': (6, 7),
            'projection_weight': 0.40
        }


# USAGE:
wildcat = calculate_ownership_targets(4170)
print(wildcat)
# {'avg_target': (9, 13), 'ultra_leverage_required': (3, 4), 'projection_weight': 0.85}

milly = calculate_ownership_targets(150000)
print(milly)
# {'avg_target': (3, 6), 'ultra_leverage_required': (6, 7), 'projection_weight': 0.40}
```

## 🏅 SPORT-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS

### **NFL (Perfect Fit)**
```
✅ Weekly slates (Sunday/Thursday)
✅ Showdown/Single-Game
✅ All GPPs 3k-15k entries

Why: Ownership projections accurate, stacking obvious, leverage clear
```

### **NBA (Good Fit)**
```
✅ Main slate (8+ games)
✅ Small slate (3-4 games)
⚠️ Showdown requires adjustments

Why: High variance, stacking works (PG+SG+C), leverage matters
Adjustment: Lower ownership targets (7-11% avg)
```

### **MLB (Moderate Fit)**
```
✅ Large slate (10+ games)
⚠️ Small slate (3-5 games)

Why: High variance, stacking critical (same team stack)
Adjustment: Stack 80% of time, lower ownership (6-10% avg)
```

### **PGA/Golf (Poor Fit)**
```
❌ Most tournaments

Why: No stacking, too random, projections unreliable
Better: Play pure leverage (all sub-5% owned)
```

### **NASCAR (Poor Fit)**
```
❌ Most tournaments

Why: High variance, random outcomes, no meaningful stacking
Better: Fade entirely or play cash games
```

### **Soccer/EPL (Moderate Fit)**
```
✅ Large slate (8+ games)
⚠️ Showdown

Why: Captain picks create leverage, stacking works
Adjustment: Focus on captain leverage, lower ownership
```

### **College Football (Perfect Fit)**
```
✅ Saturday main slate
✅ Bowl games
✅ All GPPs 3k-15k

Why: Lower ownership projections, more volatility, stacking works
Adjustment: None - same as NFL
```
